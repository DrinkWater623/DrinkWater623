### F.A.Q.
<dl>
  <dt>Drink Water 623?</dt>
  <dd>I was contemplating user names for my son a long time ago and he was no help, meaning I never got an answer... At the same time, a theme of our lives was to drink lots of water. 623, my birthday. So he became DrinkWater101 and me 623....and I kinda got attached.  I figure, unless there is another water loving person born on June 23rd... I don't have to worry about too many duplicates.</dd>
